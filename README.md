# Shopping-Cart-Exercise

The input values are being treated as strings by python even though integers are being inputted
I have added the price per pound attribute for all the items.  For the sake of this exercise the even numbered are in 'price_per_pound' and the odd ones are not.
I have also added code to handle errors if a wrong input is entered.  For example, the current products list has only 21 items. If the clerk enters 24 by mistake the code would normally error. To prevent this I have made the code adapt to wrong entries. In summary, if the clerk enters an input that is not one of the ID's assigned to a product, the system will prompt the clerk to re-enter.  Similarly if a wrong weight is entered for the 'price_per-pound', the system will classify that as an invalid entry.  Finally, the the system will recognize both 'DONE' or 'done' to finish the order.
